= The Gateway Protocol

include::common/Purpose.adoc[]

== Current status

This protocol is currently in *version 0.1*. It is not recommended for production use, and there is still
some features that need to be implemented. Sample features include:

* Continuous connection streams
* Error correction
* Push towards own network implementation instead of being on top of TCP or UDP

#If you like the idea of this protocol, please consider contributing to it. You don't have to be a genius
to write a few changes to the text, and if you don't/can't do that you can also create an issue or discussion. Writing
your own implementation or making your apps compatible with it will also help a lot to get this into the mainstream.#
